## **Why I Started Learning JavaScript (and Why You Should Too!)**

When I transitioned from office administration to IT and software, I quickly realized that JavaScript is the gateway to the web. I chose to learn JavaScript because it powers nearly every interactive website and is essential for frontend development.

What attracted me most:

- It’s beginner-friendly yet powerful.
- It works in any browser without setup.
- It connects perfectly with tools like React and Node.js, which are on my learning path.

I started with simple scripts like pop-up alerts and now I’m building mini web apps. If you’re starting in tech, JavaScript is a great place to begin.

## **My First JavaScript Project – A Simple Calculator App**

To practice what I learned, I built a basic calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It could perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Features I implemented:

- User input via buttons
- Real-time calculation with JavaScript functions
- Clean UI with CSS Grid

What I learned:

- DOM manipulation using document.querySelector
- Event handling with .addEventListener
- Importance of clean and reusable code

## **Getting Started with React: What I Learned in My First Week**

React was intimidating at first, but now I love how it simplifies web development. I used create-react-app to start and focused on learning:

- 📦 Components: I broke down my app into small reusable blocks
- 📥 Props & State: Passing and managing data between components
- 🔄 JSX Syntax: Writing HTML inside JavaScript

One week in, I built a basic “To-Do List” app with add/delete functionality. React makes dynamic UI logic easier to manage.

## **How I Use VS Code for Web Development**

VS Code became my favorite code editor fast. Here’s how I optimized it:

🔌 Favorite Extensions

- Prettier – for auto-formatting code
- ESLint – for code quality and error checking
- GitLens – to see code changes in Git
- Live Server – for instant preview in the browser

## **My GitHub Journey: Pushing My First Project**

Before, I only heard of GitHub. Now, it’s part of my workflow.

What I did:

- Created a GitHub account and a new repo
- Initialized Git locally in VS Code
- Used git add . → git commit -m "init" → git push

Why GitHub matters:

- Version control keeps code safe
- Employers check GitHub to see real work
- It’s great for team collaboration

## **Testing React Apps with Jest: My First Experience**

I started learning Jest for testing my React components.

What I tested:

- Button clicks
- Input changes
- Conditional rendering

What I learned:

- How to write simple test cases
- How to simulate events using fireEvent
- How confident testing makes code changes easier

Running npm test and seeing “✓ passed” felt very rewarding!

## **Deploying My React App with GitHub Pages**

Deploying my first app online made me feel like a real developer!

How I did it:

- Built my React app using npm run build
- Installed gh-pages package
- Updated package.json and ran npm run deploy

Now anyone can visit my app via a public URL.
Next time, I want to try Netlify for easier deployment.

## **Frontend vs Backend – What I’m Learning About Both**

As I explore development, I see the difference clearly:

Frontend (React) – What users see and interact with
Backend (Node.js, Express) – Handles data, logic, and databases

I enjoy frontend because of immediate visual feedback. But I’m also learning backend basics using Node.js and planning to explore MongoDB next.

## **npm and package.json – Why They Matter**

When I first saw package.json, it confused me. But now I get it:

- It tracks my project’s dependencies
- It manages scripts like start, build, and test
- It helps others install my app easily

Using npm install and npm run now feels natural. Learning these tools taught me how real software projects are structured.
